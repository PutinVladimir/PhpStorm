# PhpStorm utils created because:

I don't like java for IDE.

Don't like distribution as a set of archived files.

Don't like your new financial model.

So:

Don't use this while they produce javashit, worse only Electron.

If you are forced to use it at least should convert it to AppImage.

Don't pay while they don't change financial model.
